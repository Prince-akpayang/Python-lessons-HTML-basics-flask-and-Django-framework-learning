### HTML Comments

HTML comments are used to annotate code for developers and are not rendered in the browser. They serve as notes or reminders within the HTML structure. Here's how you can create comments in HTML:

#### 1. **`<!-- ... -->`**
   - Used to enclose comments in HTML.
   - Example: `<!-- This is an HTML comment -->`

#### Example:

```html
<!-- Example demonstrating HTML comments -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Header Section -->
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <p>This is the introductory paragraph.</p>
    </header>
    
    <!-- Main Content Section -->
    <main>
        <p>This is the main content area.</p>
        <!-- Nested comments can also be used -->
        <!-- <div>
            <p>Nested comments</p>
        </div> -->
    </main>
    
    <!-- Footer Section -->
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 - My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

HTML comments are useful for explaining complex sections of code, temporarily removing parts of the code for testing purposes, or providing reminders to yourself or other developers working on the project. Always remember to use comments sparingly and maintain good code readability.
